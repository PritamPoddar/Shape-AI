NumPy provides Python with an extensive math library capable of performing numerical computations effectively and efficiently. These lessons are intended as a basic overview of NumPy and introduces some of its most important features.\n",

        "Even though Python lists are great on their own, NumPy has a number of key features that give it great advantages over Python lists. One such feature is speed. When performing operations on large arrays NumPy can often perform several orders of magnitude faster than Python lists. This speed comes from the nature of NumPy arrays being memory-efficient and from optimized algorithms used by NumPy for doing arithmetic, statistical, and linear algebra operations."
